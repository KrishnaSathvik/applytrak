# Email Verification Fix Guide

## Issues Fixed

✅ **Auto-login after email verification**: Added periodic checking and improved auth state change detection
✅ **Welcome email triggering**: The welcome email will now trigger properly after verification
✅ **Supabase redirect URLs**: Updated configuration to include production URLs

## What Was Changed

### 1. EmailVerificationModal.tsx
- Added `TOKEN_REFRESHED` event handling for better auth state detection
- Added periodic verification status checking (every 3 seconds)
- Improved manual verification check to match email addresses
- Enhanced logging for better debugging

### 2. supabase/config.toml
- Added production URLs to `additional_redirect_urls`:
  - `https://applytrak.vercel.app`
  - `https://applytrak.com`

## Additional Steps Needed

### 1. Update Supabase Dashboard Settings
You need to update the redirect URLs in your Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ihlaenwiyxtmkehfoesg)
2. Navigate to **Authentication** → **URL Configuration**
3. Add these URLs to **Redirect URLs**:
   - `https://applytrak.vercel.app`
   - `https://applytrak.com`
   - `http://127.0.0.1:3000` (for local development)

### 2. Test the Flow
1. Sign up with a new email
2. Check your email and click the verification link
3. The app should automatically detect the verification and sign you in
4. You should receive a welcome email

## How It Works Now

1. **User signs up** → Email verification modal appears
2. **User clicks verification link in email** → Supabase redirects back to your app
3. **App detects verification** → Automatically signs user in via periodic checking
4. **Welcome email sent** → Triggered after successful verification
5. **User is logged in** → No manual login required

## Debugging

If issues persist, check the browser console for these log messages:
- `"Email verification detected via periodic check"`
- `"Email verified! User signed in automatically"`
- `"Welcome email sent successfully"`

The periodic checking ensures that even if the auth state change event doesn't fire immediately, the app will detect the verification within 3 seconds.
