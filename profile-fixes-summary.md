# Profile & Settings Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. **Display Name Not Reflecting Signup Name**
**Problem**: Display name from signup wasn't showing in profile and couldn't be edited.

**Solution**:
- Fixed `updateUserProfile` function to update both Supabase auth metadata AND the database `users` table
- Enhanced sign-in process to load complete user data from database including display name
- Now properly fetches and displays the display name set during signup

### 2. **Delete Account Not Working**
**Problem**: Delete account button showed "coming soon" message instead of actually deleting.

**Solution**:
- Implemented actual account deletion using the existing `privacyService.deleteAllUserData()` function
- Added proper error handling and user feedback
- Account deletion now removes all user data and signs out the user

### 3. **Notifications Configure Button Not Working**
**Problem**: Configure button was just static UI with no functionality.

**Solution**:
- Connected the "Configure" button to open the privacy settings modal
- Users can now access notification preferences through the existing privacy settings

### 4. **Quick Snooze Not Working**
**Problem**: Quick snooze buttons (15m, 1h, 4h) were just static UI elements.

**Solution**:
- Implemented `handleQuickSnooze` function that updates notification preferences in database
- Added proper database integration with `notification_preferences` table
- Users can now temporarily pause non-critical notifications for specified durations

## How It Works Now

### Display Name:

2. User signs in → Display name loaded from database and shown in profile
3. User can edit display name → Updates both auth metadata and database
4. Changes are immediately reflected in the UI

### Delete Account:
1. User clicks "Delete Account" → Confirmation modal appears
2. User confirms → All user data deleted from database
3. User is signed out and page reloads

### Notifications:
1. User clicks "Configure" → Opens privacy settings modal
2. User can manage notification preferences through existing privacy interface

### Quick Snooze:
1. User clicks snooze duration (15m/1h/4h) → Updates database with snooze settings
2. Non-critical notifications are paused for specified duration
3. Success message confirms the action

## Database Integration

The fixes properly integrate with the existing database schema:
- `users` table: Stores display names
- `notification_preferences` table: Stores snooze settings
- `privacy_settings` table: Manages notification preferences

All changes maintain data consistency and proper error handling.
